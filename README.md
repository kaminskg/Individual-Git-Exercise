## Prerequisite:
1. Have a working IDE to run this program (I used VSCode)
2. Have NodeJS installed to test this program

## What the Feature Is:
A simple JavaScript program which does a basic selection sort. The purpose of this exercise is to showcase my usage of Github for COSC 499. With this program, you can sort either words (strings/chars) or numbers(ints, floats, doubles, etc..)

## How to Use It:
1. Either use the premade arrays (numbs, words ) in the program, or modify them to your liking
2. Once you are happy with both of the arrays, in the terminal, type `node basicSort.js`
3. See the sorted arrays print out in the terminal
